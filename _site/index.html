About Me
==============================

I am Zhenghao Yin, currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Faculty of Physics, University of Vienna, Austria. 
Supervised by Prof. Philip Walther, my research focuses on quantum photonics and quantum machine learning.
My academic journey has spanned several countries and disciplines. I began with a B.Sc. in Physics from Nanjing University, followed by an M.Eng. in Electronic Engineering at Kyoto University in Japan. 

Research Interests
==============================

![Photonic quantum machine learning](venn.svg width=500px)

My research spans integrated photonics, quantum optics, and quantum machine learning. During my PhD, I focus on photonic quantum machine learning — developing and implementing quantum ML algorithms on photonic platforms, particularly photonic integrated circuits.

Key achievements include:

- Experimental quantum-enhanced kernel-based machine learning on a photonic processor, published in [_Nature Photonics_ *19*, 1020-1027 (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01682-5). We designed, simulated, and experimentally implemented quantum kernel methods on linear optical systems, benchmarking quantum interference between indistinguishable and distinguishable photons.

- Demonstrated the scaling of photon number in photonic quantum machine learning. We discovered the scaling law of learning capability by studying the gradient landscape of linear optical circuits.

- Contributed to the development of a quantum optical satellite payload, now operational in orbit — see the [press release](https://rudolphina.univie.ac.at/en/quantum-computer-from-vienna-for-outer-space).

Previous experience includes extensive cleanroom fabrication of silicon and silicon-nitride devices, with a focus on Kerr-nonlinear ring cavities/resonators for generating broadband, frequency-entangled photon pairs. I have collaborated with leading groups in Japan and China and participated in international projects and secondments.

I am active in open-source development for photonic circuit control and calibration, and I aim to advance quantum optics and explore quantum advantage in machine learning applications.
